* calcul + value variable * => not really usefull to test complicated calcul, same as calculation
*		 *    but type must be correctly assign
a = 2 * 4.5 					=> 	a must be show and use as an integer
b = 2 * [[4,5]] 				=> must be a Matrix
a = 4 + i
b = i - a; varC = b * [[1]]		=> must be -4 and be an integer so next computation mustn't be an error
z = z + 2 						=> error
i = 2
f(a) = x then f = 3				=> don't allow it, it is too confusing to have var and function with the same name






// assignment function //
* simple *

f(x) = 4
g(x) = varA - x					=> error, varA is not defined

g(what) = what * what
g(x) =?

* advanced *
varA = 27 AND varB = 53

g(x) = x ^2 - 4 / 3 + 3 % 5
y = [[4, 2]]
f(z) = z * y					=> must send z * [[4, 2]]
f(z) =?
f(x) = 2*x^5 + 4x^2 - 5*x + 4	=> must send 2 * x^5 + 4 * x^2 - 5*x + 4
funB(y) = 43 * y / (4 % 2 * y)	=> must send 43 * y / (4 % 2 * y)
funA(x) = varA + varB * 4 - 1 / 2 + x	=> must send 238.5 + x
f(x) = 3x - 1
g(x) = f(0) + 5 * x						=> must send -1 + 5x
w = 5 AND f(w) = 4w	AND f(42) =?			=> must be always 20
f(x) = 2*(x + 3*(x - 4)) AND p = 2
f(3) - f(p) + 2 =?
f(x) = 2 *x * i
f(2) = ?

* problematic * => static function resolve it
f(x) = x * 2
g(y) = f(y) + 5
g(z) =?

f(y) = f(y) * 2

f(x) = g(x)
g(x) = h(x)
h(x) = f(x)
f(2) =?

* test none static var in function *
varA = 2 AND f(x) = varA AND varA= 5
f(x)=?										=> must send 5

f(x) = x
varA = f(2)
f(x) = x + varA
* no problem because var is already calculate
