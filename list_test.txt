// syntax test //
syntax is the form of the command + name var and func + unvalid name var and func (i, exit, + with bonus)

a ==?
a42 = 5
x == 2
a = b = c
a = 5 and A =?					=>	must be 5 (insensitive to case)
a ?=
a = 4 ? + 5
= a
a =
!WARNING! 4 = 5 =? is a valid syntax for resolution of polyn




// assignment variable//

* simple without error*
a = 4
b = 4.5
b = a
b = -5
c = 0
d = -0
d = -0.0000

a = 4i - 5
b = -5 + 4i
c = a - b						=>	must be null
b = i
b = 0 * i						=> 	must be null and an integer

a = [[4]]

a = [[4]; [3]]
b = [[1,2];[3,2];[4,5]]
b =[[4,3,5,8,7,-8]]
c =[[4];[8];[-4.5];[0.0]]

* simple syntax error *

a = [[4,]]
a = [[4]a[4]]
b = [4]
c = [[4,2];]
d = [[[4,2,]]]
a = [[]]
a = [[4]

* calcul + value variable * => not really usefull to test complicated calcul, same as calculation
*		 *    but type must be correctly assign
a = 2 * 4.5 					=> 	a must be show and use as an integer
b = 2 * [[4,5]] 				=> must be a matrice
a = 4 + i
b = i - a; varC = b * [[1]]		=> must be -4 and be an integer so next computation mustn't be an error
z = z + 2 						=> error
i = 2
f(a) = x then f = 3				=> don't allow it, it is too confusing to have var and function with the same name

f(x) = 2*x^5 + 4x^2 - 5*x + 4	=> must send 2 * x^5 + 4 * x^2 - 5*x + 4
funB(y) = 43 * y / (4 % 2 * y)	=> must send 43 * y / (4 % 2 * y)
funA(x) = varA + varB * 4 - 1 / 2 + x	=> must send 238.5 + x
f(x) = 3x - 1
g(x) = f(0) + 5x						=> must send -1 + 5x
w = 5 AND f(w) = 4w	AND f(w) =?			=> must be 20

varA = 2 AND f(x) = varA AND varA= 5
