* Syntax rules *

-Functions cannot be used in other fct if they are not defined
ex: f(x) = g(2) //ERROR
ex: f(x) = y + 4 //OK

-A var can be use as you want, error will be treated in computation
ex:	f(x) = x + y * 4
	f(3)	//ERROR
	y = -3
	f(3)	//OK

-A function must be resolve in other function definition
ex: f(x) = x	//OK
	g(x) = f(0)	//OK
	var = 5
	g(x) = f(var) //OK
	h(y) = f(y)	//ERROR

* J'AIME PAS CE SYSTEME => VOIR POUR CHANGER EN STATIC ?
-Once a function is defined, it can be changed to change other functions 
ex: f(x) = x
	g(x) = f(2) * x
	g(3) =? => 6
	f(x) = x * x
	g(3) =? => 12
